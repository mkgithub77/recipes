- grated zest from 1 lemon
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- 1 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. pepper

Preheat the oven to 450F.  Place the prime rib roast on one of the lower racks of the preheated oven.

Cook the roast for 15 minutes with the oven on 450F.  This will sear the outer surface and provide for 
a crispy exterior.

After cooking for 15 minutes at 450F, turn the oven down to 325F.  Do not open the oven.  Cook at
325F for approximately 11 to 13 minutes per pound.

30 minutes before the end of the cooking time, remove the prime rib roast from the oven and check internal
temperature.  For the roast to be rare the internal temperature should be 120F to 125F but remove from
the oven when it is 115F to 120F and allow to stand for 20 minutes.  During this time the temperature
will rise about another 5 to 10 degrees.

If you want the prime rib to be done medium-rare, return it to the oven and cook a little longer.  Check
temperature in 15 minutes.  Remove when temperature reaches 125F.  Do not overcook.

Remove from the oven and loosely tent aluminium foil over the prime rib and allow it to sit for at least
20 minutes.  This will allow the juices to redistribute through the meat.

After the prime rib has rested it will be ready to carve and serve.
